# CW5-Adapter-Practice
_______________________________________________________________

This is the CW5 Adapter practice assignment. The program
creates a simple implementation of the adapter design pattern
It lets a grizzly bear be a toy bear and hug you. Simple code
with no problems implementing it. Just open the .csproject file
in visual studio. There is also a .dia file with the UML of the
program.
